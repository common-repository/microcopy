== Description ==

WHAT'S MICRO COPY
Microcopy allows you to manage those small texts on your website. 
The label of a button, the text in the footer, a small sentence that goes along with the content, all that text your developer used to include in the code because it's not supposed to be a post or page. 
Now you can get in control, just install Microcopy and change these texts whenever you want.

WHEN TO USE MICRO COPY
Microcopy was developed thinking about those who don't want to go through the code and change the all microcopies. 
Or to those who just want to give access to a team member responsible for the copywrite. 
Even for those who want to try different approaches along the way, Microcopy is the plugin that will save you hours of hard work.

HOW MICRO COPY WORKS
Install it, create the variables that correspond to your small texts, include those variables in the code and that's it. 
Your problem is over! 
You keep coding, the content guy starts writing and you'll live happily ever after ;)
